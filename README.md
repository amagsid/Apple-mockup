 ### ðŸ’¡ About the Project:
 This is a mockup of one of Apple.com pages.

 
 
  ###  Motivation:
 My goal for this project was to create a webpage with the same design language of Apple. I have always been a fan of Apple aesthetics, design and marketing in general and I wanted to see if I would reach the same level, even with a simple mockup.
